- Single and waiting for my frog prince to unbind my spell :frog::couple_with_heart:. But I don't mind taking it slow. Looking for someone who's family-oriented. Not a playah. What has my github profile turned to lol pshhhhh. If you're playing with my feelings, I play with yours. If you try to make me jealous, I will try to make you jealous. If you have other options, I can also have other options. We both play the court, that's the thumb rule here. But usually I'm loyal, but people might think I'm playing because they hurt me, so I hurt them. But in all honesty, I only ask for loyalty and no mind games and manipulation. I can't stand manipulative partners. If you show me love, I show the same. If you show me disloyalty, I will show disloyalty. If you want forgiveness, prove your worth, cuz I know my worth. Not settling for less than I deserve. I've given people many chances, even though they didn't deserve it. So show me either you deserve me or you don't. If I'm a challenge to you, and not worth, I'm sure someone else will take that risk.

What I'm currently _focusing_ __on__:

Currently improving my coding skills: Datastructure, Linked lists, Queues, Stack, Hash table, IoT systems.

Currently working on: Vocal voice. I might make cover videos soon, but I'm shy.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm singing, playing piano/guitar, studying languages. I'm not the biggest social person, but once you get to know me, I will never stay quiet. :sweat_smile: I talk a lot, fun to be around with, full of life and passion, crazy and funny, is what people describe me as.
