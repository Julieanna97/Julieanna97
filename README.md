- Single and waiting for my frog prince to unbind my spell :frog::couple_with_heart:. I want someone who wants kids and marriage. Someone who won't run away. Someone who will stay with me. Someone who's in love and attracted to me. Someone who lights up the room and the only one I notice when someone enters. Someone who's loyal, full of passion, drive and love to give. Someone who loves me for me. I'm picky as hell, mind you. If I choose you, that means you were the only one that caught my eye. Haha so dramatic of me ok bye~

What I'm currently _focusing_ __on__:

Currently improving my coding skills: Datastructure, Linked lists, Queues, Stack, Hash table, IoT systems.

Currently working on: Vocal voice. I might make cover videos soon, but I'm shy.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm singing, playing piano/guitar, studying languages. I'm not the biggest social person, but once you get to know me, I will never stay quiet. :sweat_smile: I talk a lot, fun to be around with, full of life and passion, crazy and funny, is what people describe me as.
