What I'm currently _focusing_ __on__:

Currently improving my coding skills: Datastructure, Linked lists, Queues, Stack, Hash table, IoT systems.

Currently working on: Vocal voice. I might make cover videos soon, but I'm shy.

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm singing, playing piano/guitar, studying languages. I'm not the biggest social person, but once you get to know me, I will never stay quiet. :sweat_smile: I talk a lot, fun to be around with, full of life and passion, crazy and funny, is what people describe me as.
